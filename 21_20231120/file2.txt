In the whispered breath of "this," a moment takes its shape,
A fleeting touch of presence, a space we can't escape.
It points to what's immediate, what's close and within reach,
An anchor to the now, its lessons there to teach.

"This" speaks of the present, of moments passing by,
It holds the fleeting seconds beneath the vast sky.
In simple words and gestures, its power does unfold,
In "this" resides a story, waiting to be told.

And then there's "these," a plural form of close embrace,
Encompassing the near, a group in shared space.
"These" extend connections, a gathering of sorts,
In their collective presence, unity exhort.

They gather things and people, items you can touch,
A collection of moments that mean so much.
"These" link us together, in bonds that will not cease,
Uniting what's around us in harmony and peace.

So "this" and "these," both words of binding tie,
Connecting us to moments that swiftly pass us by.
They weave the fabric of life, in stories that unfold,
In "this" and "these" lies the essence, precious, pure as gold.
